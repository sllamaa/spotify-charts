# Spotify Charts
This project explores and analyzes global and regional Spotify Top 200 chart data to uncover trends in popular music. It involves examining song attributes such as genre, artist popularity, track duration, and chart performance over time. Through data cleaning, visualization, and trend analysis, we identify patterns in hit songs, recurring artists, and country-specific preferences. The goal is to gain insights into what makes a song successful on streaming platforms.
